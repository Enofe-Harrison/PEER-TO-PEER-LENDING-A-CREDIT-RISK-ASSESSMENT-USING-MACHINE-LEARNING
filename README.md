PROJECT PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The increasing popularity of peer-to-peer lending has solidified its position as a noteworthy component of alternative lending, emerging as a fresh option within the realm of 
financial services. Nevertheless, the primary concern when investing in P2P lending lies in default risk, which is the probability that borrowers will fail to repay their debt 
obligations when due. This stems from the absence of collateral and analytical expertise, increasing the likelihood of default of borrowers on the platforms. Hence, the objective of 
this project is to (1) develop a credit scoring model for predicting the probability of default of borrowers based on the information they provided using Logistic regression (LR), 
Random Forest (RF) and Decision tree (DT) Models (2) evaluate the performance of RF and DT against the benchmark model LR using the confusion matrix and the AUC-ROC 
curve performance index measures to determine best model in terms of accuracy, precision, Recall and F-Score.

Furthermore, the present state of the P2P lending markets in Asia, America and Europe as explained above has raised the question: Which model is the most accurate in reducing the 
likelihood of borrowers defaulting on P2P lending platforms, using the data they provide? This project attempts to answer this question by employing classification models.
